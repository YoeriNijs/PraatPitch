# PraatPitch
Praat script for listing some F0 statistics (min. pitch, max. pitch, mean pitch, median, standard deviation, and audio duration). Based on the work of Jonas Lindh. 

This script is optimized to read audio files with children's voices. Therefore the positive minimal pitch is set to 200 Hz and the maximal pitch is set to 600 Hz. Of course, you can adjust this setting. 

Please note that, in order to run the script, you need Praat (see: http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), and that you write the file paths correctly. The backslash on the end of the path is necessary to run the script.
